## PurpleOnyx Theme
With the advent of Onyx Theme to Desktop, Discord got close to satisfying what I wanted.

This completes what I wanted that Discord still doesn't address.

Features reduced padding/margins and more compact menu's; all with a light accent of various shades of Purple.

Initial Settings:
Onyx (midnight) should be enabled. Theme was built based on "UI Density" and "Message Spacing" set to "Compact"
User Avatars are hidden, and "Space Between" is set to Zero.
